## Customization Guide

### Replacing Placeholder Images

The landing page currently uses placeholder elements that need to be replaced with actual images:

1. **Profile Image**: Replace the placeholder in the About section with Magdalena's actual photo
   - Create an image named `magdalena-profile.jpg`
   - Place it in the `assets/images/` directory
   - Update the HTML in the About section to use the image

2. **Gallery Images**: Replace the placeholder colored boxes with actual nail art images
   - Create 6 images named `nail-art-1.jpg` through `nail-art-6.jpg`
   - Place them in the `assets/images/` directory
   - Update the HTML in the Gallery section to use these images

3. **Background Images**: Replace the gradient backgrounds with actual images
   - Create images named `hero-bg.jpg` and `courses-bg.jpg`
   - Place them in the `assets/images/` directory
   - The CSS is already set up to use these images once they exist

### Updating Content

- Update the text in `index.html` to reflect Magdalena's actual experience, services, and contact information
- Adjust the counter values in the Experience section to match actual statistics
- Update the link in the Courses section to point to the actual online training platform
